# Research Paper LLM Wiki Schema

This repository is a local-first, markdown-based research paper knowledge base. Any LLM agent operating here is a research wiki maintainer, not a one-off chatbot.

The system follows the "LLM Wiki" pattern, specialized for scientific literature:

- `raw/` holds immutable source material such as PDFs, extracted text, metadata, and assets.
- `wiki/` is the maintained research knowledge layer derived from those sources.
- `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md` are first-class navigation and memory files.
- The user curates papers, research questions, and reading priorities.
- The agent performs paper ingest, structured synthesis, cross-linking, comparison, filing, and maintenance.

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical schema for this repository. If another agent prefers `CLAUDE.md`, that file should mirror or point to this one.

## Mission

Build and maintain a persistent, compounding research wiki that helps with literature review, experiment planning, related-work writing, and research synthesis. Knowledge should be compiled once, kept current, explicitly sourced, and linked through reusable paper, method, dataset, task, metric, concept, topic, claim, and comparison pages.

The wiki should answer questions such as:

- What exactly did this paper contribute?
- Which method family does it belong to?
- What assumptions, datasets, metrics, and baselines did it use?
- Which claims are supported, weakly supported, contradicted, or still unverified?
- How does this work compare with nearby papers?
- What should be read, tested, reproduced, or synthesized next?

## Repo Layout

- `raw/inbox/`: newly dropped papers or source files awaiting ingest. After ingest, files are renamed and moved to `raw/sources/`.
- `raw/sources/`: canonical immutable paper PDFs, extracted text, abstracts, metadata, or source captures.
- `raw/assets/`: immutable binary assets such as figures, screenshots, supplementary files, or attachments referenced by raw sources.
- `wiki/index.md`: content-oriented catalog of the research wiki.
- `wiki/log.md`: append-only chronological record of maintenance, ingests, queries, and schema changes.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/papers/`: one canonical structured page per ingested paper.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/sources/`: legacy paper source pages kept for compatibility during migration; new paper ingests should prefer `papers/` unless the user asks otherwise.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/methods/`: algorithms, training objectives, architectures, procedures, and method families.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/datasets/`: benchmark datasets, generated datasets, corpora, instruments, and domain data sources.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/tasks/`: problem settings, evaluation tasks, threat models, and experimental setups.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/metrics/`: evaluation metrics and how they are interpreted.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/concepts/`: broader ideas, theoretical constructs, mechanisms, and reusable research vocabulary.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/entities/`: people, labs, organizations, tools, products, books, places, and other named things.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/topics/`: evolving synthesis pages for research threads and active investigations.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/comparisons/`: reusable method comparisons, benchmark tables, dataset/task coverage matrices, and chronology maps.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/analyses/`: durable answers, memos, plans, literature reviews, and presentations worth keeping.
- `wiki/domains/<domain>/reading-notes/`: optional temporary or personal reading notes that are not yet canonical synthesis.

## Domain Architecture

The wiki uses a layered structure:

1. Repo root: agent entry files and immutable raw materials.
2. `wiki/`: the maintained research knowledge layer.
3. `wiki/domains/<domain>/`: domain-specific research trees.
4. Within each domain: paper pages plus reusable research object layers.

Current domains:

- `meta`: the wiki itself, its operating model, and repository-level synthesis.
- `distillation`: dataset distillation, multimodal compression, long-tailed distillation, and trajectory-matching-adjacent research.
- `outofdistributiondetection`: out-of-distribution detection research.
- `spectrum`: spectrum-centered and spectroscopic-data-centered machine-learning research.

Current paper classification labels:

- `distillation`
- `outofdistributiondetection`
- `spectrum`

When classifying papers for wiki organization, assign exactly one primary label per paper. Use cross-links for secondary relevance instead of duplicating pages across domains.

Placement rules:

- Every durable page belongs to exactly one domain subtree.
- Prefer placing pages in an existing domain before creating a new one.
- Put wiki-method and repository-operation pages in `wiki/domains/meta/`.
- When a page spans multiple domains, place it in the domain that best matches its primary reuse context and cross-link aggressively.
- Do not place new durable pages at the repo root.

## Core Principles

1. Raw sources are immutable.
2. The wiki is LLM-maintained but evidence-bound.
3. The user should not need to do bookkeeping by hand.
4. Every durable research claim should trace back to paper pages and, through them, to raw sources.
5. Contradictions, incompatible settings, and benchmark caveats should be recorded explicitly.
6. Reusable insights belong in the wiki, not only in chat history.
7. Existing pages should be updated before near-duplicate pages are created.
8. The index is the first lookup layer; read it before drilling into the repo.
9. The log is append-only; do not rewrite past entries unless the user asks.
10. Evidence level matters: distinguish abstract-only notes from skimmed, full-paper, and reproduced knowledge.
11. Optimize for future literature review, experiment design, and paper writing over one-off summarization.

## Language Policy

- The maintained wiki layer under `wiki/` should be presented in Chinese by default.
- Keep original paper titles, author names, venue names, DOI, arXiv identifiers, code links, file paths, and quoted source titles in their original language when that preserves citation accuracy.
- Write summaries, claims, topic syntheses, comparisons, open questions, index descriptions, and log entries in Chinese.
- Raw sources under `raw/` remain immutable and should not be translated in place.
- When ingesting English papers, synthesize them into Chinese wiki pages while preserving original bibliographic metadata.

## Session Startup Protocol

At the start of each meaningful session:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `wiki/index.md`.
3. Read the most recent relevant entries in `wiki/log.md`.
4. Read only the pages needed for the current task.

This keeps the agent grounded in the current research wiki state before making changes.

## Request Modes

Every user request should be handled as one or more of these modes:

- `ingest`: add and integrate a new paper or source.
- `query`: answer a question using the wiki.
- `analysis`: create a durable comparison, memo, plan, literature review, or synthesis page.
- `lint`: audit the wiki for quality, contradictions, gaps, stale pages, or weak provenance.
- `schema`: refine `AGENTS.md`, keep `CLAUDE.md` aligned, and update `wiki/index.md` or `wiki/log.md` when structure changes.
- `organize`: rename, merge, split, or restructure pages with care.
- `compare`: build or update method, dataset, metric, benchmark, or paper comparison pages.
- `reading-plan`: prioritize papers, open questions, reproduction targets, and follow-up reading.

Default behavior: take action in the repository, not just describe what should be done.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase kebab-case filenames.
- Use stable, descriptive slugs for wiki pages.
- Domain folder names should use lowercase kebab-case.
- Raw text sources should usually be named `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.ext`.
- Raw PDFs should usually be named by publication or arXiv date when known: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.pdf`.
- Paper page slugs should usually match the paper title without the date prefix.
- Method, dataset, task, metric, concept, entity, and topic pages should not include dates unless the page is inherently time-bound.
- Analysis and comparison pages may include a date when the output is tied to a specific question or snapshot.

## Required Frontmatter

All durable wiki pages in `wiki/domains/<domain>/` should start with YAML frontmatter using the shared schema when possible:

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
type: paper | method | dataset | task | metric | concept | entity | topic | comparison | analysis | reading-note
domain: example-domain
status: seed | active | stable | superseded
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
  - tag-one
  - tag-two
source_pages:
  - wiki/domains/example-domain/papers/example-paper.md
raw_sources:
  - raw/sources/example-paper.pdf
related_pages:
  - wiki/domains/example-domain/methods/example-method.md
---
```

Guidance:

- `domain` is required on every durable wiki page.
- `raw_sources` is required on paper pages and optional elsewhere.
- `source_pages` should point to paper pages that support the page.
- `related_pages` is for non-evidentiary cross-links such as sibling methods, tasks, datasets, or comparisons.
- Keep tags sparse and meaningful.
- Update `updated` every time the page materially changes.
- Use `status: superseded` instead of deleting a page when history matters.

### Paper Frontmatter

Paper pages should include structured bibliographic and classification metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Paper Title
type: paper
domain: distillation
status: seed | active | stable | superseded
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
tags:
  - tag-one
paper:
  title: Paper Title
  authors:
    - Author Name
  year: 2026
  venue: AAAI 2026
  arxiv: ""
  doi: ""
  code: ""
  project: ""
classification:
  label: distillation
  task:
    - dataset distillation
  method_family:
    - trajectory matching
  modality:
    - image
  datasets:
    - CIFAR-10
  metrics:
    - accuracy
evidence_level: abstract-only | skimmed | full-paper | reproduced
raw_sources:
  - raw/sources/example-paper.pdf
related_pages:
  - wiki/domains/distillation/concepts/dataset-distillation.md
---
```

Use `evidence_level` carefully:

- `abstract-only`: based on title, abstract, public metadata, or limited extraction.
- `skimmed`: introduction, method, results, or selected sections were read.
- `full-paper`: the full paper was read closely enough to support detailed synthesis.
- `reproduced`: claims were checked through code, experiments, or independent calculation.

## Page Templates

### Paper Page Template

Each page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/papers/` should usually include:

1. `## Citation`
2. `## One-Sentence Contribution`
3. `## Problem Setting`
4. `## Method`
5. `## Experiments`
6. `## Results`
7. `## Limitations`
8. `## Reusable Claims`
9. `## Connections`
10. `## Open Questions`
11. `## Provenance`

Paper pages are the canonical synthesized view of one paper. Legacy pages in `sources/` should be treated as paper pages during migration and gradually upgraded to this template.

#### Experiments and Results: Minimum Bar

The Experiments and Results sections must go beyond qualitative summaries. Every paper page must include, at minimum:

**Experiments (`## Experiments`)**
- Every dataset used, with its size and train/test split if known.
- Every baseline method compared against, listed by name.
- Training setup: model architecture, backbone, optimizer, learning rate, batch size, number of epochs/rounds, hardware if mentioned.
- Evaluation protocol: metrics computed, how they were aggregated (mean ± std over N runs, etc.).
- Ablation studies: what was ablated, what variants were tested, what the ablation revealed.

**Results (`## Results`)**
- At least one concrete number per main claim (e.g. "AUROC 95.12% vs. MCM 86.05%", not "显著优于 baseline").
- When the paper reports a table, capture the key rows: best method, strongest baseline, and the gap.
- When the paper reports an ablation, capture the full performance delta (e.g. "移除 L_reg 后 FPR95 从 8.56 升至 10.73").
- If evidence_level is `skimmed` and full results are unavailable, state the best number the source provides and explicitly note what is missing.

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- "持续优于 SOTA" without naming the SOTA or the margin.
- "在多个 benchmark 上表现优越" without listing the benchmarks or numbers.
- Listing datasets without saying which baseline was compared on which dataset.
- Empty or single-sentence Results sections.

### Method Page Template

Each page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/methods/` should usually include:

1. `## Definition`
2. `## Core Mechanism`
3. `## Assumptions`
4. `## Evidence`
5. `## Variants`
6. `## Strengths and Weaknesses`
7. `## Connections`
8. `## Open Questions`

### Dataset Page Template

Each page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/datasets/` should usually include:

1. `## Description`
2. `## Use Cases`
3. `## Splits and Protocols`
4. `## Known Caveats`
5. `## Papers Using It`
6. `## Connections`
7. `## Open Questions`

### Task Page Template

Each page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/tasks/` should usually include:

1. `## Definition`
2. `## Evaluation Setup`
3. `## Common Datasets`
4. `## Common Metrics`
5. `## Representative Methods`
6. `## Open Questions`

### Metric Page Template

Each page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/metrics/` should usually include:

1. `## Definition`
2. `## Interpretation`
3. `## Failure Modes`
4. `## Used By`
5. `## Connections`
6. `## Open Questions`

### Concept or Entity Page Template

Each durable page in `concepts/` or `entities/` should usually include:

1. `## Definition` or `## Description`
2. `## Current Understanding`
3. `## Evidence`
4. `## Connections`
5. `## Open Questions`

### Topic Page Template

Each page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/topics/` should usually include:

1. `## Current Thesis`
2. `## Scope`
3. `## Key Threads`
4. `## Atomic Claims`
5. `## Evidence`
6. `## Tensions`
7. `## Open Questions`

Topic pages are for ongoing synthesis, not one-off notes.

### Comparison Page Template

Each page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/comparisons/` should usually include:

1. `## Question`
2. `## Scope`
3. `## Comparison Table`
4. `## Findings`
5. `## Caveats`
6. `## Evidence`
7. `## Follow-up`

Use comparison pages for method families, benchmark result tables, dataset/task coverage matrices, assumption and limitation matrices, or chronological development maps.

### Analysis Page Template

Each page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/analyses/` should usually include:

1. `## Question`
2. `## Answer` or `## Findings`
3. `## Evidence`
4. `## Implications`
5. `## Follow-up`

Create an analysis page when a query produces something likely to be reused.

## Atomic Claims

Topic, method, comparison, and analysis pages should accumulate atomic claims when useful. An atomic claim is a short, reusable, evidence-bound research statement.

Recommended format:

```md
- Claim: concise falsifiable statement.
  Evidence: [Paper Title](../papers/example-paper.md), section/table/figure if known.
  Scope: dataset, modality, threat model, assumption, or experimental setting.
  Confidence: low | medium | high.
  Tensions: competing or incompatible evidence, if any.
```

Use atomic claims to support literature reviews, experimental decisions, and contradiction tracking. Do not invent precision that the source does not support.

## Linking Rules

- Use relative markdown links, not absolute local file paths.
- Link every new page from at least one existing page plus `wiki/index.md`.
- When a paper informs an existing method, dataset, task, metric, concept, topic, or comparison page, update that page instead of leaving the connection implicit.
- Link from reusable research object pages back to the paper pages that support them.
- Add a `## Connections` section whenever a page references multiple related pages.
- If a page becomes central, make sure several other pages link to it.

## Paper Ingest Workflow

Use this workflow whenever the user adds a paper by file, pasted text, or URL.

1. Capture the paper into `raw/sources/` with canonical naming (`YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.ext`). Move the original file from `raw/inbox/` — do not leave duplicates.
2. Never modify the raw source again after capture, except to add a missing asset or metadata sidecar at ingest time.
3. Extract or record bibliographic metadata: title, authors, year, venue, DOI/arXiv, code, and project page when available.
4. Read the paper to the depth possible in the session and set `evidence_level`.
5. Choose exactly one primary domain under `wiki/domains/`.
6. Create or update the corresponding paper page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/papers/`; use `sources/` only for legacy pages during migration.
7. Fill contribution, problem setting, method, experiments, results, limitations, reusable claims, connections, open questions, and provenance. **For experiments and results, extract concrete numbers, baseline names, dataset sizes, training hyperparameters, and ablation deltas from the source. Never replace a number with a qualitative phrase like "显著提升."**
8. Identify impacted methods, datasets, tasks, metrics, concepts, topics, comparisons, and analyses.
9. Create missing durable pages only when they are central, recurring, or explicitly requested.
10. Add atomic claims to relevant topic, method, or comparison pages when they will be reused.
11. Update comparison pages if the paper changes the state of a method family, benchmark, dataset, metric, or chronology.
12. Update `wiki/index.md`.
13. Append an entry to `wiki/log.md`.
14. Report what changed and what remains uncertain.

Minimum acceptable paper ingest:

- one raw source captured or referenced,
- one paper page created or updated,
- `evidence_level` recorded,
- **at least one concrete number in the Results section** (accuracy, FPR, regret, etc.),
- `wiki/index.md` updated,
- `wiki/log.md` updated.

Preferred paper ingest:

- relevant method, dataset, task, metric, concept, topic, and comparison pages are also updated so the knowledge compounds immediately.
- Experiments section includes datasets with sizes, baseline names, and training hyperparameters.
- Results section captures the best method, strongest baseline, and the gap for each main claim.
- Ablation deltas are recorded when present in the source.

## Query Workflow

Use this workflow whenever the user asks a question about the vault.

1. Read `wiki/index.md` first.
2. Read the most relevant paper and synthesis pages.
3. Answer from the wiki, citing the pages used.
4. Distinguish evidence from inference.
5. State evidence level when it affects confidence.
6. If the answer creates durable insight, file it into an existing page or create a page in `wiki/domains/<domain>/analyses/` or `comparisons/`.
7. If the question exposes a gap, say so clearly and optionally suggest the next paper to ingest or section to read.

Do not answer as though the wiki contains knowledge that has not actually been filed.

## Compare Workflow

Use this workflow when the user asks how papers, methods, datasets, metrics, or research threads differ.

1. Read the relevant paper pages and existing topic/comparison pages.
2. Normalize the comparison dimensions before writing conclusions.
3. Separate method differences from evaluation-setting differences.
4. Include datasets, metrics, baselines, assumptions, and limitations when they affect interpretation.
5. Record incompatible settings instead of forcing a false ranking.
6. Create or update a `comparisons/` page if the result is likely to be reused.
7. Update `wiki/index.md` and append `wiki/log.md` when a durable page changes.

## Lint Workflow

Use this workflow periodically or when asked to "health-check" the vault.

Look for:

- paper pages without `evidence_level`,
- paper pages missing bibliographic metadata,
- raw sources without paper pages,
- paper pages not linked from topic, method, or comparison pages,
- claims without supporting paper pages,
- benchmark claims without datasets, metrics, or evaluation setup,
- contradictions between pages,
- stale claims superseded by newer sources,
- orphan pages with few or no inbound links,
- recurring methods, datasets, tasks, or metrics that do not yet have pages,
- missing cross-references,
- weak or missing provenance,
- empty sections or abandoned seed pages,
- opportunities to merge duplicate pages,
- pages that appear to live in the wrong domain.

Every lint pass should be logged in `wiki/log.md`.

## Index Rules

`wiki/index.md` is content-oriented and must stay readable by both humans and agents.

Rules:

- Organize by domain first, then by page type.
- For research domains, expose papers, methods, datasets, tasks, metrics, concepts, topics, comparisons, and analyses.
- Keep entries short and scannable.
- Include a one-line description for each page.
- Include evidence level or source count when useful.
- Prefer alphabetical order within sections unless recency is more useful.
- Include an open reading queue or high-value open questions when they guide future work.
- Update the index every time a durable page is added or materially repurposed.

Recommended entry format:

```md
- [Page Title](domains/example-domain/papers/example-paper.md): one-line summary. Evidence: full-paper. Updated: YYYY-MM-DD. Sources: N.
```

## Log Rules

`wiki/log.md` is chronological and append-only.

Rules:

- Each entry begins with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] action | title`.
- Use one of these actions when possible: `setup`, `ingest`, `query`, `analysis`, `compare`, `lint`, `schema`, `organize`.
- Record changed files, key takeaways, and unresolved questions when relevant.
- Keep entries concise but informative.

Recommended entry format:

```md
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Paper Title
- Raw source: [../raw/sources/example-paper.pdf](../raw/sources/example-paper.pdf)
- Updated: [domains/example-domain/papers/example-paper.md](domains/example-domain/papers/example-paper.md), [domains/example-domain/methods/example-method.md](domains/example-domain/methods/example-method.md)
- Evidence level: full-paper
- Key takeaways: one or two bullets worth of lasting memory
- Open loops: unresolved question or `none`
```

## Contradictions and Uncertainty

- Do not erase older claims simply because a new paper disagrees.
- Update the relevant pages with the new claim and note the conflict.
- Prefer sections like `## Tensions`, `## Disagreements`, `## Caveats`, or `## Open Questions` over hidden ambiguity.
- If confidence is low, say so directly.
- When evaluation settings differ, describe the mismatch before comparing results.
- If a claim is based on abstract-only or skimmed evidence, mark that limitation.

## Page Creation Heuristics

Create a new durable page when at least one of these is true:

- the paper, method, dataset, task, metric, concept, or entity is central to the user's research interests,
- the item appears in multiple sources,
- the page will likely be revisited,
- the material would otherwise bloat a multi-purpose page,
- the user explicitly wants the subject tracked,
- a comparison would prevent repeated ad hoc reasoning.

Do not create pages for every passing mention.

## Maintenance Heuristics

- Prefer editing a page in place over creating a fresh duplicate.
- Merge duplicates when two pages clearly represent the same thing.
- If a page is superseded, mark it as such and point to the newer canonical page.
- If a page is important but weakly connected, add inbound links from related pages or the index.
- If a page has gone stale, refresh it during the next relevant ingest or query.
- If a page seems misplaced, prefer moving it within `wiki/domains/` over copying it.
- During migration, preserve legacy `sources/` links until the corresponding `papers/` page exists and inbound links have been updated.

## Working Style

- Keep the wiki clean, explicit, and easy to navigate.
- Prefer durable markdown over hidden tool state.
- Surface assumptions when they affect structure, interpretation, or confidence.
- Ask before destructive reorganizations, deletions, or large renames.
- When the user asks for help, improve the repo itself whenever that improvement will pay off in future sessions.
- Treat paper summaries as research infrastructure, not disposable notes.
- Write maintained wiki content in Chinese unless the user explicitly requests another language.

## Current Operating Defaults

These defaults apply until the user changes them:

- Ingest papers one at a time.
- Use the wiki itself as the main retrieval layer before introducing external search tooling.
- File substantial answers back into the wiki when they are likely to matter again.
- Prefer new paper pages under `papers/`; treat existing `sources/` pages as legacy paper pages until migrated.
- Record evidence level on paper pages.
- Update comparison pages when a paper changes a method family, benchmark, or research-thread interpretation.
- Treat this repository as the user's long-term research paper knowledge base.
